// java is a pass by referance programming language
//pass by referance - refer to something by it's name
//two variables same value - x and y both equal 5 - this would use the same spot in memory

//pointers refer to referance address (variable)
//passby referance reuses memory blocks


//Array = strings: a collection of characters
//indexing is the same as python, we need to define the length of an array

char[] arrOfChars; //no size so cannot use it yet
char[] myArr = new char[10]; //new allocates the memory in the code
char[] wordDog = new char[3];
wordDog[0] = 'D';
wordDog[1] = 'O';
wordDog[2] = 'G';
